# playroomIcons
Working on some SVG icons for the toy bins in my kidâ€™s playroom. Will be cut into vinyl stickers from vinyl scrap I have laying around. Doing just what I need for my house, but feel free to use them, add more, whatevs.

Icons are meant to be cut out of a rounded rectangle or circle. You can then use the positive for one side of a container and the negative for the lid or opposite side
